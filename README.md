# Design App Remastered
This is a very cool (in my opinion) application using typscript and props for colours as an excercise project. I think it turned out pretty well

## Features
- Can change colours and review on the spot for a possible website colour palette
- Details which explain what each aspect of text in the website should be, in addition to contrasts etc
